# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To complete the Combined Scenarois.
## Algorithm:
Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.
